Interactive display of a mad lib, which is provided as a Python format string,
with all the cues being dictionary formats, in the form {cue}.
In this version, the cues are extracted from the story automatically,
and the user is prompted for the replacements.
Original mad lib adapted from code of Kirby Urner
